### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex

I currently work as a Senior Network Engineer at [Presidio Federal](https://presidiofederal.com). I help our customers modernize their data centers and assist with their transition to cloud.

My interests lie in making hybrid, multi-cloud networking easy and consumable for any and everyone.

I am a cohost of the [Cables2Clouds](https://www.cables2clouds.com) podcast.

Follow my [blog](https://bumpsinthewire.com) to see the kinds of things that I'm up to.
