# Alex Perkins | Senior Infrastructure Engineer

## Reliability & Automation | 15+ Years Enterprise Infrastructure

👋 Hi, I'm Alex. I specialize in bridging the gap between mission-critical physical networking and modern software-defined reliability. With over a decade of experience in enterprise infrastructure, I am currently scaling my expertise into the SRE domain, with a focus on **eliminating operational toil** through automation.

🔧 Technical Expertise

- Automation: Bash, Python, Git, CI/CD

- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible

- Systems & Orchestration: Linux, Docker, Kubernetes

- Cloud Architecture: AWS Networking, Security, and Scalable Design

- Observability: Proactive monitoring, log parsing, and system auditing

📂 Featured Proof of Work

Check my [SRE-study-notes](https://github.com/bumpsinthewire/SRE-study-notes) for production-ready logic, including:

- Exposure Auditor: Automated network security auditing via Python.

- Service Sentinel: Proactive system health monitoring and alerting.

🎓 Academic Focus

B.S. in Physics (Data Science minor) at Arizona State University. I apply mathematical rigor and systemic modeling to complex engineering challenges.
